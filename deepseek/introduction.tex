\section{Introduction}

Concrete compressive strength prediction remains pivotal for structural engineering quality control. While traditional methods employ log-linear transformations of age and water-binder ratios \citep{Yeh1998}, contemporary machine learning approaches offer enhanced predictive accuracy \citep{Abdallah2022}. This investigation rigorously evaluates both paradigms through 1,030 experimental measurements, addressing three critical gaps in existing literature:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&1.\ \text{Quantification of linear model limitations under sparse age distributions} \\
&2.\ \text{Systematic comparison of cement vs composite binder formulations} \\
&3.\ \text{Interpretation of machine learning predictions via SHAP analysis}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
